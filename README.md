# A little educational DIY app

The goal of this app is simply to refresh my HTML, CSS, TypeScript and React knowledge. To build something from scratch, without coding along with a tutorial.

## How to run this project

- Clone the repo
- npm install
- npm run dev

## Scope of this project

- Use standard CSS. Doesn't have to be fancy; no bootstrap, tailwind, bulma or any other CSS framework
- Do something with an external API
- React basics:
  - Reusable components
  - React Router
  - Props & prop drilling
  - Hooks:
    - useState
    - useEffect
    - useContext
    - (useReducer ?)
